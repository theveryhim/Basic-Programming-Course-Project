 I designed this game in CodeBlocks environment using C++ 
 programming and SDL2 graphics. It is more of a simplified
 version of the famous one. All of necessary files including
 explanations(persian) are provided as a zip file just make 
 sure about directions on your device. I suggest you to take
 a quick look at main file.

note:
 mp3 files should be next to main file to perform currectly.
